## JC2 SetWeather

As part of my little project to give the server console some more functionality, I've now written "SetWeather". This script allows you to set the weather server-wide to either "Sunny", "Raining", or "Storm".

`weather`
List all available weather climates

`weather 1`
Sets the weather to "Sunny"

`weather 2`
Sets the weather to "Raining"

`weather 3``
Sets the weather to "Storming"
